# Getting CBRT EVDS data to R using function.
In this project, I used R to import data from evds with API key and series names. This way I eliminated the excel or csv file downloading from internet thus increased the productivity of the analysis.

## This project is used in Bahcesehir Financial Research Center with ongoing optimizations. Code may not be up-to-date.
